You will need to request trade data from the Comtrade data extraction API of the United Nations (UN) and further process, analyze and visualize the data.

### No registration: This is a Public API. Hence, you can use the API as a guest user, i.e. without registration and authentication (which would cost money).
### API documentation: The UN Comtrade data extraction API is described in detail here: https://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api. You will need to carefully study this API and the provided explanations.
